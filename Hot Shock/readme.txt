The excel sheet "Material Properties.xlsx" contains all the relevant material properties. 
The properties used in analysis are under the "nominal" tag for each property group - the minimum and maximum are used to define the ellipses on Ashby plots.
Nomenclature:
E = Young's Modulus
K IC = Fracture Toughness
alpha = Coefficient of Thermal Expansion
k = Coefficient of Thermal Conductivity
sigma c = Maximum Compressive Strength
sigma t = Maximum Tensile Strength
sigma flex = Maximum Flexural Strength
rho = Material Density
cp = Specific Heat
T max = Maximum Allowable Temperature
nu = Poisson's Ratio
